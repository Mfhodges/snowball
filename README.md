# snowball :snowman:  
A Snowball Poem Generator that generates snowball poems from raw text with Markov Chains

---

Since my senior thesis has to do _loosely_
with Markov chains I thought it might be fun to do a 'lil side project with them. I also read this really cool memoir, [*Virtual Muse*](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/2399/) , about the nature of poetry and how computer programming has given some insight into it's possibilities. It's not very programming heavy, but it does a really good job of showing that computers do have something worthwhile to contribute to the art world. As someone who is worried that computer science is ruining society this was a pleasant respite.

#### What is a Markov Chain ??

[Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) are a stochastic ( randomly determined ) model that describes a sequence of possible events. The probability of each even depends only on the previous event's state transition. This makes for a really simple model for imitating very complexity situations.


#### How will I implement this?
I found [this nice blog](https://agiliq.com/blog/2009/06/generating-pseudo-random-text-with-markov-chains-u/) post by Shabda Raaj about generating text with Markov chains using my native language Python and will be using this to kickstart my project. However the links to his files are all broken. :disappointed:
